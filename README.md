**✨ Project Overview**

The BI + ML Platform is a browser-based analytics application that works like a lightweight Power BI / Tableau alternative but with an integrated Machine Learning engine.


Users can upload any dataset and automatically perform:

✔ Data Cleaning
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Business Intelligence Dashboards
✔ Machine Learning Model Training
✔ Predictions on new data
✔ Time-Series Forecasting
✔ Automated Business Insights

All of this happens without writing additional code once the platform is running.


🎯 Problem the Platform Solves

In many organisations, data is stored in spreadsheets but extracting insights requires either:

💰 Expensive BI tools (Power BI, Tableau)
👨‍💻 Skilled data scientists

This platform removes both barriers by providing:

✔ Open-source analytics tools
✔ Automated ML pipelines
✔ End-to-end data workflow in one application


🧠 Key Features

📂 Upload Dataset
Upload CSV or Excel datasets directly into the application.


🧹 Automatic Data Cleaning

Missing value handling
Duplicate removal
Outlier detection
Categorical encoding


📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Distribution plots
Scatter plots
Correlation heatmaps
Boxplots by category


📈 Business Intelligence Dashboard

KPI cards
Time-series charts
Category comparison charts
Segment distribution visuals


🤖 Machine Learning Models

Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree


🔮 Predictions
Predict outcomes for new data with probability scores.


📉 Forecasting
Generate future predictions using ARIMA time-series forecasting.


📑 Automated Insights
Generate business insights like revenue concentration and performance gaps.


🏗 System Architecture

The platform follows a two-layer architecture:

🖥 Presentation Layer
Streamlit dashboard pages
⚙ Logic Layer
Central data manager handling:

Data loading
Cleaning
Machine learning
Forecasting
Insight generation


⚙ Technology Stack

| Technology      | Purpose                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| 🐍 Python       | Core programming language  |
| 🎈 Streamlit    | Web application framework  |
| 🐼 Pandas       | Data manipulation          |
| 🔢 NumPy        | Numerical computation      |
| 🤖 scikit-learn | Machine learning models    |
| 📊 Plotly       | Interactive visualizations |
| 📉 statsmodels  | ARIMA forecasting          |


All libraries used are free and open-source.

📊 Machine Learning Models

The platform trains multiple models automatically and compares performance.

| Model               | Type           |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| Random Forest       | Classification |
| Gradient Boosting   | Classification |
| Logistic Regression | Classification |
| Decision Tree       | Classification |
| Linear Regression   | Regression     |
| K-Means             | Clustering     |


Evaluation metrics used:

✔ Accuracy
✔ F1 Score
✔ AUC-ROC

🔮 Forecasting

Time-series forecasting is implemented using ARIMA models.

The forecasting pipeline:

1️⃣ Aggregate data by time period
2️⃣ Train ARIMA model
3️⃣ Generate predictions
4️⃣ Display confidence intervals

If ARIMA fails, the system uses a linear regression fallback.

📄 Insight Generation

The platform automatically generates insights such as:

📉 Revenue concentration (Pareto analysis)
📊 Segment performance gaps
⚠ Risk alerts for high churn rate
📈 Trend analysis across time

These insights help translate data into actionable business decisions.
